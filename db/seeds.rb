# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:

  Movie.create([{ title: 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi', release: 12/16/1983, reception: 94, description: "one of the best movies of all time", watch:'HBOMAX' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
